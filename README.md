# Overview

This Weather forecast application was created with the intent of demonstrate the knowledge adquired in Java.

This Weather forecast displays a menu where the user can choose between checking the current weather, or see a weather forecast for the next 3 days. Once the user has picked what they want to see, the program will ask the user to enter the name of a city. 
Once the name of the city is entered, the program retrieves data from an external API and store the data in json format.
When all the data is stored in json format, the program displays the information to the user.
